# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Submission Instructions
Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?
Features: List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search for blog posts containing given text.
Create Post: Users will be able to create new blog posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user’s profile.
Technologies: What languages and technologies will you use to build your application? For example, for the coding-events application from Unit 2 - Java, the technologies would be:
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates
What you’ll have to learn: In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.
Project Tracker: Link to your Trello board here.
Enable GitHub Issues: If you haven’t already enabled GitHub Issues do so before submitting this assignment. If you haven’t enabled GitHub Issues yet your mentor will not be able to give you feedback on your project!

### Overview
Teah T.V. is an organizational app that stores the information and location of a users movie/tv collection in a searchable, editable, and smooth database. It is named after my mother Teah who has moved into the cozy quarters of a retirement home. She is a movie fanatic and has collections of DVDs and Blue Rays that can no longer be displayed so  they need to be consolidated into disc holders and binders(Even though she owns digital copies of most of them anyway...). This will allow the user, my mom, to quickly and conveniently locate the desired movie's information. This could be formatted to work with collections and data catalogs of any kind.

### Features
Admin login: Admin needs to login to be able to add and edit the database.
Search: Users will be able to search through the catalog by movie title, director, year released, category, disc type, and location.

### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Javascript

### What I'll Have to Learn
Javascript for admin to interact and edit the catalog directly.
